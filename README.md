# Watset: Automatic Induction of Synsets from a Graph of Synonyms

Watset is a local-global meta-algorithm for fuzzy graph clustering. The underlying principle is to discover the word senses based on a *local* graph clustering, and then to induce synsets using *global* clustering.

Originally, Watset was designed for addressing the synset induction problem. Despite its simplicity, Watset shows excellent results, outperforming five competitive state-of-the-art methods in terms of F-score on four gold standard datasets for English and Russian derived from large-scale manually constructed lexical resources.

The code in this repository is task-specific. We found that Watset works very well not just for synset induction, but for a lot of other fuzzy clustering tasks. **Please use a much faster and convenient implementation of Watset in Java: <https://github.com/nlpub/watset-java>.**

## Outline

A synonymy dictionary can be perceived as a graph, where the nodes correspond to lexical entries (words) and the edges connect pairs of the nodes when the synonymy relation between them holds. The cliques in such a graph naturally form densely connected sets of synonyms corresponding to concepts. Given the fact that solving the clique problem exactly in a graph is NP-complete and that these graphs typically contain tens of thousands of nodes, it is reasonable to use efficient hard graph clustering algorithms, like MCL and CW, for finding a global segmentation of the graph.

However, the hard clustering property of these algorithm does not handle polysemy: while one word could have several senses, it will be assigned to only one cluster. To deal with this limitation, a word sense induction procedure is used to induce senses for all words, one at the time, to produce a disambiguated version of the graph where a word is now represented with one or many word senses.

More specifically, the method consists of five steps presented: (1) learning word embeddings; (2) constructing the ambiguous weighted graph of synonyms *G*; (3) inducing the word senses; (4) constructing the disambiguated weighted graph *G'* by disambiguating of neighbors with respect to the induced word senses; (5) global clustering of the disambiguated graph.
